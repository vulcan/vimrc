the vim plugin directory is indend to transfer between windows and Linux,
but there are some different

the files put under the .vim file is only used for linux
because windows doesnot support pipe, the python compiler
should use pymake.py instead.

when copy plugin and settings from windows
backup these files before replace the .vim directory
then copy efm_filter.py to .vim/tools
and python.vim to .vim/compiler
